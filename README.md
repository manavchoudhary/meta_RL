# Meta Reinforcement Learning
This repository implements the meta-reinforcement learing architecture as proposed in ["Learning to reinforcement learn"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05763), Wang et al., 2016. We use CartPole-V0 environment for our experiments.

This repo is inspired by [Florentin's thesis](https://github.com/fhennecker/meta-reinforcement-learning) and [Arthur's implementation](https://github.com/awjuliani/Meta-RL)
